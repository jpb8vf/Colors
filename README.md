# Colors
Description: Create an iOS app with a View Controller that contains a Table View that displays a list of colors.

Purpose: The challenge provides experience with View Controllers, Table Views, and Swift collections.

Requirements:

Project Name: Colors
Target Platform: iOS Single View Application
Language: Swift
Devices: Universal

This project is to be managed in a public GitHub repository. For the challenge assignment submit the Clone with HTTPS URL for the repository.

Create an Xcode project that is an iOS Single View Application and choose Swift for the programming language and Universal for devices.

Delete the ViewController.swift file from the project that is automatically provided when an iOS Single View Application is created. You are to create a View Controller that has a descriptive name. Never use generic names like ViewController.swift. The names you use for classes, structs, code files, etc. let other programmers know where to find things.

The goal of this project is to display a Table View in a View Controller that contains the following list of colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, and brown.

The app's UI is to have an Initial View Controller that contains a Table View. The View Controller is to serve as the delegate and data source for the Table View. The Table View is to display the list of colors with one color displayed in each Table View Cell. The Table View is to have autolayout constraints such that it is 0 points from the top and bottom safe areas (previously called layout guides) and 0 points on the leading and trailing sides to the superview. Do not have a margin on the leading and trailing sides of the Table View. The Table View is to go all the way to the edges of the display on the left and right.

The code file for the custom class (subclass) of the View Controller is to be created and named something descriptive.

The resulting app should look like the following.
